A playable example can be found at [aakashkcx.github.io/chess-game/](https://aakashkcx.github.io/chess-game/), with its source code at [aakashkcx/chess-game](https://github.com/aakashkcx/chess-game).

This project features a chess engine built using TypeScript - a high level language, in stark contrast to the low level languages typically found to be used to build chess engines. This allows for a greater emphasis and easier understanding of the concepts behind artificial intelligence design while providing much greater code readability.

Many thanks to the [Chess Programming Wiki](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page) and its community for the resources and information that they have provided.

_This project is based on my final year project at university._
